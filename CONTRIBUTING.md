# Welcome!
Welcome to the Homiehub Homelab repository. Currently, I'm just using this as a place to store my homelab code and have left it public so I don't have to pay for branch protection rules. You're welcome to attempt to use this code in its current state or fork it if you like, but I can't promise it has the stability or bare minimum developer amenities you might expect out of a more developed open-source project. Consider yourself warned! 

You can find a guide for setting up a development environment in the [README.md](https://github.com/wrightgabriel0220/homiehub-homelab/blob/main/README.md#self-hosting-for-development)

## How to contribute
1. Pick an issue you'd like to fix or create one.
2. Checkout a branch from main via
```
git checkout -b <your name>/<issue type>/<short issue title>
```

### Issue Types
- feat: something that adds a new feature/enhancement
- chore: refactors and cleanup
- fix: bugfixes, should not be used for refactoring

## Creating Issues
When creating an issue, make sure to utiize the Github features we've implemented in this repo:
- **Assignees**: 
  - Assign yourself if you plan to implement the feature or fix. Otherwise, allow someone else to assign themselves when they take up the issue.
- **Labels**:
  - Follow the label descriptions for guidance on what labels apply to your issue. **Please try not to forget to add these. They help with organization a lot!**
- **Project**: *Homiehub Homelab*
- **Milestone**:
  - Milestones represent major batches of changes, usually associated with a particular user or developer experience. Take a look at the milestones and their descriptions available and set yours to one if it applies. Milestones are optional, but they only remain accurate if we attach all of their dependent issues, so please attach the milestone if it does apply.
