# Welcome!
Welcome to the Homiehub Homelab repository. Currently, I'm just using this as a place to store my homelab code and have left it public so I don't have to pay for branch protection rules. You're welcome to attempt to use this code in its current state or fork it if you like, but I can't promise it has the stability or bare minimum developer amenities you might expect out of a more developed open-source project. Consider yourself warned! 

## How to contribute
1. Pick an issue you'd like to fix
2. Checkout a branch from main via
```
git checkout -b <your name>/<issue type>/<short issue title>
```

### Issue Types
- feat: something that adds a new feature/enhancement
- chore: refactors and cleanup
- fix: bugfixes, should not be used for refactoring
